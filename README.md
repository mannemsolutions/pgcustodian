## Why

With the rise of PostgreSQL distributions with support for TDE, we see bash scripts trying to integrate PostgreSQL TDE with Hashicorp Vault.
This tool is meant to replace them with a small simpel binary which includes all required functionalities with a simple interface.
And this tool is tested with unittests and e2e tests to make sure that it does what it needs to do.
