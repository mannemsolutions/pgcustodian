# about

This is copied from https://github.com/lu4p/shred/blob/master/shred.go.
It seems like what I need, and has a [free and unencumbered license](https://github.com/lu4p/shred/commit/d9cb34d6af65ea510f950e94721a1b6bdc56ad3d).
But the project also seems stale (last commit 5y ago).
So I's rather preserve this in my own project than lean on unmaintained code.
